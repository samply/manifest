<h2>Who is the Samply community?</h2>
<p>The Samply community started as a group of software developers and scientists from research institutions at different locations, founded to build software for scientific purposes, networking and federated research.
As an open source community, it is our goal to provide the Samply software developed during individual projects to all members of the community.</p>
<p>Originally established within the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), the Samply initiative's open-source licensed software is used by several European scientific projects and research networks.</p>

<h2>Communication and organisation within the community:</h2>
<p>All members of the Samply community are expected to comply with the principles and conventions of the Samply manifest.</p>
<p>Each individual member of the Samply community moreover adheres to the rules of the <a href="https://berlincodeofconduct.org">Berlin Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>The Samply community is self-organised and self-committed to divide the workload, implement the software requirements and review pull requests.</p>
<p>An open communication culture prevails. Although we develop and use Samply in a variety of independent research projects, we are committed to communicating ideas, problems and changes openly.</p>
<p>For discussions, questions, complaints or feature requests, contact the developers via the <a href="mailto:dev@samply.de">Samply mailing list</a>, <a href="https://github.com/samply">Issue Tracker</a> or <a href="https://chat.germanbiobanknode.de">Samply chat</a>.</p>
<p>Our working language for documentation is English. In meetings, we will choose our working language based on the preferences of the attendees.</p>
<p>The Samply community is represented by the Samply committee. The members of the Samply committee decide by a majority about organisational topics like changes to the internal workflow. Modifications to the Samply manifest must be agreed unanimously by the committee members.</p>
<p>The Samply committee consists of at least five, and at most nine members. If possible, at least two different active projects associated with the Samply software should be represented in the Samply committee.</p>
<p>Current committee members may propose new committee members. Alternatively, community members may request admission to the committee. In both cases, the committee decides about the admission to the committee. Each committee member is elected for 12 months. Re-election is possible.</p>
<p>Each Samply component is curated by one or more maintainers. Those who engage intensely in the development and enhancement of a component are predestined to become its maintainer (see <a href="https://github.com/samply/manifest/wiki/List-of-component-maintainers">list of component maintainers</a>).</p>
<p>The Samply committee determines the component maintainers in agreement with potential candidates.</p>
<p>Meetings should take place biannually and every member of the community is invited to participate. In addition, the Samply committee organises web conferences to inform the members about news, changes and the roadmap.</p>
<p>The appointment and location of a meeting is organised by the committee. The meeting agenda will be prepared by all participating members.</p>
<p>If you would like to join the Samply community, please register for our Samply mailing list by sending an email to <a href="mailto:join@samply.de">join(at)samply.de</a>. You can leave the community the same way. Communication via the mailing list is archived and might be made public.</p>

<h2>Principles and guidelines of software development:</h2>
<p>Our source code is provided "as is" without warranty on our public <a href="https://github.com/samply">GitHub repositories</a>. The Samply committee is reponsible for deciding on appropriate licencing of the source code.</p>
<p>Every member of the Samply community works according to the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org">principles of agile software development</a>.</p>
<p>It is assumed that each member of the Samply community contributes to the processing of requirements and pull requests according to their own abilities and interests.</p>
<p>We aim to provide Docker buildfiles for each Samply application, and to publish them on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/samply">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<p>We do not have Samply-wide release trains. However, each project employing Samply can maintain 'Samply distributions' to establish their own release trains.</p>
<p>Component maintainers are the contact persons for the components and allowed to approve pull requests and release new versions. They are responsible for implementing bug fixes and keeping the component compatible with linked components.</p>
<p>The members of the Samply community are self-obligated to adhere to our <a href="#catalog">criteria catalogue for pull requests</a>.</p>

<br />
<hr />

<h1 id="catalog">Our criteria catalogue for pull requests:</h1>
<p>Make your code as clean as possible according to coding best practices (check out 'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin for reference).</p>
<p>Projects will be version-controlled according to <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model">Gitflow</a>. There are two permanent branches, 'master' and 'develop'. Temporary branches can be established in addition to this for features, hotfixes and release.</p>
<p>The software versioning uses a three-figure version number, following the <a href="https://semver.org">guidelines of Semantic Versioning 2.0.0</a>.</p>
<p>The master branch is the current stable release version. The develop branch is a copy of the latest master branch containing additional newly developed features and changes. It forms the basis for the next release.</p>
<p>Never work in the master branch! Establish a new temporary branch from the current develop branch for development (e.g. feature, hotfix), which will be merged into the develop branch following a successful pull request.</p>
<p>It is possible to add the appendix 'SNAPSHOT' for versions under development. Avoid dependencies from a SNAPSHOT version, unless the concerned version is also a SNAPSHOT. The develop and master branch must never depend on SNAPSHOT versions.</p>
<p>Pull requests should be addressed by Samply committee members and especially the responsible component maintainers. To approve a pull request, the acceptance of a component maintainer is required.</p>
<p>Component maintainers need to be aware that pull requests are of high priority and should be tended to within 2 days. Delays in pull request approval might otherwise slow down the entire developement process.</p>
<p>Only the component maintainers are allowed to merge branches into develop and to push from develop into the master branch for a new release. New features should be merged from the develop into the master branch within two weeks.</p>
<p>For Java software, we support one OpenJDK version on release. The Samply committee discusses and determines the supported version and potential version upgrades.</p>
<p>We keep external dependencies as low as possible. External libraries have to be suggested to the Samply committee and agreed by the affected component maintainers before use.</p>
<p>Each modification should be communicated to the component maintainer. Other involved community members should also be informed promptly.</p>
<p>Whenever a modification is made to interfaces, we will perform a system test.</p>
<p>We use a Samply license header for our software. Embedding this header is a requirement for each Samply component.</p>
<p>For each release, we ensure compatibility is maintained between connected Samply components (for combinations, check the releases tabs or the docker compose files of the deployments at <a href="https://github.com/samply">GitHub/Samply</a>). If necessary, we modify affected Samply components to ensure compatibility.</p>
<p>For very good reasons, it is possible to deviate from the rules of this criteria catalogue. Please inform affected community members and the Samply committee about any deviations promptly.</p>
